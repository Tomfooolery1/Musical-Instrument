## 10/26/2025 - Created Switch Matrix  

After adding a Raspberry Pi Pico, I created a switch matrix by connecting wires, diodes and switches together in rows and columns so that the number of pins needed is reduced.

It went well and helped me learn about how to use KiCad.

## 11/1/2025 - Made Rotary Encoders  

Created Rotary Encoders for my MIDI board. 
It is going well, however I am confused on how everything works. As I am new to Electronics, I am unsure as to whether or not it will work when it comes to testing (or even how to test it)
I will try to continue as best I can to create a Musical Instrument
